## How do?

The content on here is not set up to be a [5etools](https://5e.tools/)-compatible repo, mostly because I'm too lazy to figure it out. Using the "Load from URL" button on the [Homebrew Manager](https://5e.tools/managebrew.html) page, you can paste the following links:

* [Bonus Action (Patreon Gold Tier)](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/EmberHeartshine/5erepo/master/collections/Bonus%20Action%3B%20Patreon%20Gold%20Tier.json)
* [Bonus Action - Relics of the Realm](https://github.com/EmberHeartshine/5erepo/raw/master/collections/Bonus%20Action%3B%20Relics%20of%20the%20Realm.json) (has literally nothing in it yet)
