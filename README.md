## How do?

The content on here is not set up to be a [5etools](https://5e.tools/)-compatible repo, mostly because I'm too lazy to figure it out. Using the "Load from URL" button on the [Homebrew Manager](https://5e.tools/managebrew.html) page, you can paste the raw link of any json file in this repo.
