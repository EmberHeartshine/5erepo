							"The Possessed are created in a Lazarus Wave event, a phenomenon first discovered by Arcanist Luren Insoren during her Lazarus Project. While most victims exposed to Argent biowaves will expire without further effect, some subjects will absorb traces of Argent energy and enter a state of posthumous vigor. Despite necrosis on the internal organs (with the exception of the brain), the victim continues to animate and exhibit a low order of sentinence for weeks or even months after death. Posthumous brain activity in the possessed is limited to instinctive behavior. The possessed are known to be territorial when confronted by the living. When isolated, they will often enter a dormant state for extended periods of time. They will stand, unmoving, for days or weeks at a time until presented with a live food source, or threatened by a predator."

							"Despite their low status among the demon ranks and their seemingly endless number, imps have unique characteristics in battle. Some prefer fighting from an elevated position, while others will rush their target and swipe at them with razor sharp claws. Walls and obstacles offer no defense against imps as they will leap great heights and easily hang from surfaces. The imp is capable of channeling Argent energy through its hands and shaping it into a projectile. As the imp channels the energy, airborn particles and debris are sucked into the malestrom to create a condensed, superheated fireball. The mechanics of the imp's ranged attacks suggest that they are actually a lower form of the {@creature summoner|doom}."
